# State Comptroller - WORK IN PROGRESS

Opening auditing data from the [Israeli State Comptroller][website].

## Code

This directory holds the 2015 yearly report,
extracted manually from the [State Comptroller's website][website] and dumped into YAML files.

A CLI Python script can convert these YAML to JSON
and dump them into Elasticsearch for nice data discovery.
